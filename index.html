          Hello and welcome to my e-portfolio. My name is Nafeesah Bari, 
          and I was recently a Warner Music Group (WMG) apprentice. 
          While I aim to go into a business professional background, I also love 
          collaborating & learning from others.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I want to be a successful professional in business operations such as a technical analyst or other forms of business or marketing operations. I
        want to deliver the best of my skills through my vast experiences of teamwork, technical background, communication skills, & the fast adaptability I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning about cultures around me. This includes music, media, & even languages. Grown up in a diverse community, I'm bilingual in Bengali
        & in my free time, study Japanese. Cultural knowledge is powerful & I want to evoke it through my skills & interests in the digital business.
      </p>
      <p>
        A prominent goal of mine is to become financially independent for me & my family. I want to work in digital business & tech because I find it the 
        most rewarding. I want to work in an environment where I will be economically stable but where I can service my technical & business skills to use.

            The goal was to create a calculator. I was using Python to complete
            this project. I did some research on what methods to use for this.
            Ultimately, I created a GUI for a mortgage calculator.

            My goal was to use a learning based platform, Pluralsight to
            create a weather application. I followed the steps on how to
            create my own app using the details provided and render real
            data from a JSON file so that it can be reported to my weather app.

            Using a learning platform, Plural Sight I delved into this project to
            better understand JavaScript in the User interface (UI/UX design). The aim
            was to see how design happens while calculations are incorporated from a 
            backend perspective.
