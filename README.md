# HTML-profile-Project

GOAL: Build a profile site that is all about you and to showcase all the work that you will do during your apprenticeship!

This is a chance to show off who you are, what you’re about, and what you’ve accomplished.

Your page will focus on four main areas:

#1 --> Home Page
This landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, a mission statement, and something which defines you. Using a quote is a great idea, as well.

#2 --> Bio Page
Your bio page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

#3 --> Experience Page
This should highlight your past experience, both professionally and academically. Include employers/schools as you might on a resume, and list accomplishments at each organization.

#4 --> Portfolio Page
The meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you’ve worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web. Since we don’t have any projects to display yet, placeholder images/links/descriptions are completely fine.
